### Battle Feats
- Unarmed Striker: Increase your unarmed strike damage die to a d8 + half your level, rounded down. You no longer need equipment to properly damage someone wearing armor when attacking unarmed.
- Duelist: When fighting an enemy with no combatants adjacent to either of you, you gain a +1 class bonus on TH and damage rolls.
- Sentinel: Opportunity attacks cost only 1 SP, and can be performed on an approaching target. Standing still for a round maintains a +1 to your AC.
- Marksman: Make a unique action of 2 seconds once per turn to steady aim, reducing the critical hit threshold by 2 on your next ranged attack.
- Stormer: Consecutive hits increase the damage of the next strike, up to a maximum of 3. Missing an attack resets the stacking damage, but performing other actions maintains the stack.
- Assassin: Attacks performed on a flanked, blinded, or surprised target do additional damage equal to half your level, rounded up.
- Crusher: You always deal half your maximum damage when wielding a 2 handed weapon, even if you roll lower.

### Outside
A pond sits inside a cave where a Water Weird resides, holding a key. It appears to be swirling within the water, which itself has a circular current.

1. A set of lockers within hold tourists' belongings on the North side. The South holds a bench and a bucket with tide shoes. The Southern door is locked with a DC 10 lock. On the other side is a set of 1d6 + 3 undead skeletons.
A hexagonal room, adorned with tablets on the wall depicting the burial process for the Barrow, has a door to its North, East, and South. another hallway leads back to the entrance to the star room.
2. Another hexagonal room contains 1d4 + 2 skeletons and a Drowned. A Western offshoot contains offerings of gold, shells, pearls, and other fine things worth $1000. The door leading further in locks behind once shut.
3. Another hexagonal room contains aged alchemical ingredients, including several aged potions of healing. However, some are a different hue and are meant for preserving bodies. Ingesting these does 1d4 poison. Here several statues can be seen with coins over their eyes.
4. The water here glows with a blue-green hue. Several bioluminescent mushrooms line the walls, and the Incarnation can be heard in spot 5. Faint scratches on the wall appear on the furthest Eastern side, where with a DC 8 Notice check, one can see that it is hollow. Destroying the wall reveals 2 magical items of use, an Onyx worth $1200, and a bundle of resin that is strangely dry (Fire Resin, 1d4) Little droplets of water come to life and swarm around the walls and feet of the adventurers.
5. Two Drowned and a water weird stand way in this location. One of the Drowned is armed with a pistol, which it has a 1/4 chance of blowing its hand off with.
Star Room: A statue of a mourning woman, along with a basket of tide shoes, stands alone here. On its plaque reads, "A lifetime of yearning, till I am carried away by the River Man." Placing coins on its eyes opens a container with gold coins worth $2000, one magic Ring of Water Walking, and one Magic Ring of Fire Resistance (2).

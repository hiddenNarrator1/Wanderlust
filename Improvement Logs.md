### Barrows
- Energy Spiral: Enemies are diff. terrain
- Cantrips only add Cast Magic.
- Saving Throws for Magic: 6 + Cast Magic + INT or RES.
- Increase enemy Armor: All armor is buffed by 1.
- Zombies: 1/3 chance of revival when at 0 HP.
- 1s free movement: You may move up to your movement once for free.
- Lunging Attack: Maybe something that polearms can do... adds +2 after a charge.
- Destructive Blast Buff: d6 -> d8. Note that your Mana spent here returns AFTER the scene is over.
- Note most important stats (Martial: STR/AGI and END, Expert: INT and PER, Mage: INT and RES, Priest: END and RES)
- Change Priest Stats to END and RES, have miracles be altered with Cast Magic (Bountiful Life, Hidden in Shadow, Holy Words, Protective Embrace, Sacred Relic)
- Niche skills redo: Instead of having different skills for a bunch of different backgrounds, I am going to simplify things. For casters, there will be a Cast Magic and Know Magic skill, which you may roll normally for any magic. HOWEVER, if a background or class seems relevant to a check (e.g. a priest looking at last rites) they roll with advantage instead. I am also adding a History skill and otherwise removing the niche skills.

### Maintaining
Modifying equipment requires a tech to maintain the installed modifications. A person's maintenance score is equal to INT + END + 3 times Fix. Some mods also have a Fix skill minimum or require salvage. Salvage consists of rare pieces that are not commonly found on the market.

### Installation
Installing a mod needs a shop, which can be rented for $750 a day, or be bought for $180,000. Installing mods takes a week of work, or half as much if the technician does nothing but install.

Mods are generic and, once made, can be swapped between items. Doing so takes a day of work.

### Failure
Mods stop working if they are not maintained for a day.

### Creating Stock Items
Stock items take one week to make if it's a portable device such as a consumable, weapon, or armor. The time to make is halved with an assistant, although they must have Fix 1 or higher. 
When making items, they are either jury-rigged, normal, or mastercrafted. Consumables cannot be jury-rigged or mastercrafted.
Jury-rigged is at 1/4 cost and half building time, and will stop working if it is not maintained for 24 hours.
Normal items cost twice the amount as compared to the market and take the normal amount of time to build.
Mastercrafted items cost 10 times the base price and take twice as long to make. However, they have one free mod that requires no maintenance.

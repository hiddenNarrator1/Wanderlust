Modifying equipment requires a tech to maintain the installed modifications. A person's maintenance score is equal to INT + END + 3 times Fix. Some mods also have a Fix skill minimum or require salvage. Salvage consists of rare pieces that are not commonly found on the market.

Installing a mod needs a shop, which can be rented for $750 a day, or be bought for $180,000. Installing mods takes a week of work, or half as much if the technician does nothing but install.

Mods are generic and, once made, can be swapped between items. Doing so takes a day of work.

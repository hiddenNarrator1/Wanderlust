### Abilities
**(Level 1) Caster of Magicks**: You have a starting Power of 1 that enables you to cast spells. You may choose a source of your magic below, or create one of your own. You begin with 3 Power 0 spells, and 5 Power 1 spells. As you go along your journey, you can learn more spells from sources identical to your own. Each spell takes a week of your time to learn and a mentor, or twice as long without a mentor.
**(Level 3, 5) Alterations**: You can, with extra mental effort, perform an alteration on spells. This can change the nature of its targeting, shape, effect, elemental affinity, and so on. Choose 2 below, and add 1 at every odd level. Each alteration has a second and mana cost.

### Origin of Magicks
**Academic**: You are a standard wizard, through and through. You write your spells in a grimoire, either in gold ink or using a spellcasting module on a digital device. You may graft spells from other grimoires into your own, allowing you to learn without a mentor over a week, or half as much with a mentor. However, you may only have a number of spells prepared equal to your level + INT or RES, whichever is highest. Preparing spells can only occur over a rest.
**Enchanted**: You have a well of magic within yourself that enables you to cast spells using the physical and mental form. Add your END to your MP. Healing items can be used to restore MP, though it is half as effective.
**Pact**: You have made some sort of pact with a powerful being, be it monstrous creature or a god from the heavens. You have one spell that you can cast an unlimited number of times, which you may swap out at a level-up. However, you cannot learn spells from others, and instead gain two spells per level up, or as a reward from your patron.

### Spell Alterations
- **Instant Spell (0s, 2 MP)**: A spell does not require somatic or verbal components.
- **Spellbounce (1s, Spell MP)**: A spell bounces from one target in range, to another target within that range. Both targets are affected by the spell and the spell is subject to the same restrictions as stated in its description.
- **Spell Burst (1s, Half Spell MP)**: A touch spell instead has a 5ft. AOE effect around you.
- **Spell Extension (Spell Cast Time, Half Spell MP)**: A spell with a long duration can be extended once more, as if cast one more time, regardless of range.
- **Spell Stasis (6s, 2 MP)**: A spell's casting is paused up to one minute. This does, however, require deep concentration.
- **Transmute Spell (1s, 2MP)**: Change the spell's damage type to one you are able to cast.

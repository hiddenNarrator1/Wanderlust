### Attributes
**Strength**: The raw power that the character can exert. This directly adds to melee damage, enables the character to carry more, push/pull more weight, and overpower obstacles with brute force.
**Agility**: A character's body coordination and ability to perform complex movements. Careful navigation across difficult terrain, maintaining balance, dodging attacks, and other acrobatic feats fall under this attribute.
**Endurance**: The character's ability to take hits, survive poison, work for long periods, and deal with other bodily strain.
**Intellect**: A character's general ability to think abstractly about subjects. The more intelligent the character, the more skills they can pick up, and the better their ability is to learn about new things.
**Perception**: Controls a character's hand-eye coordination and ability to perceive the world around them using their senses.
**Resolve**: A character's willpower, their general force of personality. Often used for controlling one's natural magic or resisting mental control. It also controls the character's general charisma, their social impressions.

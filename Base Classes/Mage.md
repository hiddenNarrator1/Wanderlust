### Abilities
**(Level 1) Caster of Magicks**: Choose an Origin for your magic. An origin changes how you interact with spellcasting and limits you to a given type of magic (in parentheses). In addition, you also have a Power of 1, gaining 3 Power 0 Spells and 5 Power 1 spells. As you go along your journey, you can learn additional spells from sources identical to your own. Each spell takes a week of your time to learn with a mentor, or twice as long without.  
**(Level 3, 5) Alterations**: You can, with extra mental effort, perform an alteration on spells. This can change the nature of its targeting, shape, effect, elemental affinity, and so on. Choose 2 below, and add 1 at every odd level. Each alteration has a time and mana cost.  

### Origin of Magicks
**Academic (Arcane)**: You are a standard wizard, through and through. You write your spells in a grimoire, either in gold ink or using a spellcasting module on a digital device. You may graft spells from other grimoires into your own, allowing you to learn twice as fast. However, you may only have a number of spells prepared equal to your level + INT or RES, whichever is highest. Preparing spells can only occur over a rest.  
**Enchanted (Choose One)**: You have a well of magic within yourself that enables you to cast spells using the physical and mental form. Add your END to your MP. Healing items can be used to restore MP, though it is half as effective.  
**Pact (Divine or Occult)**: You have made some sort of pact with a powerful being, be it monstrous creature or a god from the heavens. Choose a spell rom your list that you can cast an unlimited number of times, which you may swap out at a level-up. However, you cannot learn spells from others, and instead gain one spell per level up, or as a reward from your patron.  
**Soul (Primordial)**: Your magic comes from a deep well of enlightenment, a connection to the web of life. You may use Guard in place of your Mana at twice the cost, and spell buffs restore your Guard by your level.

### Spell Alterations
- **Instant Spell (0s, 2 MP)**: A spell does not require somatic or verbal components.
- **Spellbounce (1s, Spell MP)**: A spell bounces from one target in range, to another target within that range. Both targets are affected by the spell and the spell is subject to the same restrictions as stated in its description.
- **Spell Burst (1s, Half Spell MP)**: A touch spell instead has a 5ft. AOE effect around you.
- **Spell Extension (Spell Cast Time, Half Spell MP)**: A spell with a long duration can be extended once more, as if cast one more time, regardless of range.
- **Spell Stasis (6s, 2 MP)**: A spell's casting is paused up to one minute. This does, however, require deep concentration.
- **Transmute Spell (1s, 2MP)**: Change the spell's damage type to one you are able to cast.

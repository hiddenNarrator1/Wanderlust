Health/Guard: d6 + modifier. Half is Guard (which allows you to add AGI) and the other is Health (which adds END).


Martial: d6 + 1 + half AGI + half CON *Starting at 9ish HP, and 7 HP per level-up.*
Expert/Priest: d6 + half AGI + half CON
Mage: d6 - 1 + half AGI + half CON

OR

Martial: 8 + half AGI + half CON starting, add 3 + half AGI + half CON per level up.
*10ish starting HP, 5 per level up.*
Expert/Priest: 6 + half AGI + half CON starting, add 2 + half AGI + half CON per level up.
*8ish starting HP, 4 per level up.*
Mage: 5 + half AGI + half CON starting, add 2 + half AGI + half CON per level up.
*6ish starting HP, 3 per level up.*
Approximations assume an average choice for the AGI, CON mods.

When going up a tier and choosing an Expert or Master class, you get a new starting class HP boost and assume that tier's health scaling.
**Example**: Let's assume half AGI + half CON for this character is 3. A character starts as a Martial and levels up all the way for the Novice tier, for a total HP of $(8+3) + (4 \cdot 6) = 35$. If the same character chooses the Magus Expert class, then they gain an additional $5+3=8$ HP upon receiving the class, and they gain $2+3= 5$ HP per level up, as designated by the Magus.

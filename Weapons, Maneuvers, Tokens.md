## Weaponry
Attacking with...
- Small Melee, Medium Melee, Pistols: 2s
- Large Melee, Rifles: 3s
- Techniques: Usually attack time.
Each attack has a multi-attack penalty (MAP) that halves damage per stack. This refreshes when the round ends.
## Tokens
Each weapon has techniques that players can perform with enough **momentum tokens**. These are similar to weapon properties in that they can’t be swapped out, although some may be learned by players individually.

Some properties may also allow for new techniques. 

### Gaining Tokens

Tokens are gained through the following methods.
**Performing a Maneuver**: Whether successful or not, a maneuver will always give a player an additional token. Maneuvers include Main Actions such as disarming, grappling, feinting, etc.
**Using an Item**: If an item is used specifically not to attack an individual, but instead apply an advantage of some kind, the player gains a token. Examples of this include healing items, buffs, debuffs, anything that would not cause direct damage by activation. 

 ### Maneuvers
 Maneuvers are rolled as opposing attribute checks plus your level. Effects last for 1 round.
- Trip/Shove/Grapple (2s): STR vs. STR. Success allows you to knock the target prone, move them 5 ft, or Grapple them.
- Feint (Attack): Roll competing AGI vs. PER. Next attack adds +2.
- Disarm (Attack +1s): STR or AGI vs. STR or AGI. Roll an attack first and then roll opposing checks if the attack connects. Success sends the object skittering 10 ft in a random direction (roll d8).
- Targeted Strike/Sunder (Attack Time + 1s): Roll at a -4 penalty. If it connects, a debuff is placed on the target or an item is attacked.
- Harrying Fire (Attack +1): PER vs. AGI. Target's Armor decreases by -2.
- Covering Fire (Attack +1): PER vs. AGI.  Target's Armor increases by +2.
- Move: 15ft per 1s.
- Recover: 6s, trade Strain for Guard.
### Techniques
Time for techniques is equal to attack time plus one second. Damage done by techniques ignore armor.
